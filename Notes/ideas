Accounts so people can log in and see data relevant to their leaderboard
Could have a global version/setting to see how you stack against the rest of the world in the games in your library overall 

Account 
    - STEAMID (needed to be used in the steamAPI call to find out information about achievements)
    - Username (primary key)
    - Maybe some serialised object holding cached data on leaderboard information? This could save doing API calls, user could click a refresh/update button to make that API call

Possible technologies
    - Docker
    - FrameWork
        - Blazor - C#
        - DJango - Python
    - SQL storage of information
    - nginx? Throwing that in there cos ive heard of it but dont really know what it does in the grand scheme of things
